To implement the following algorithm effectively, it's crucial to understand its key components and the sequential flow of operations. Here's a formal description of the algorithm:

1.\textbf{Input Data Processing}:
   - As a user continuously inputs data into a file, the module \text{`number of char counter.py`} processes each chunk of data.
   - Upon receiving a chunk of data, the \(\text{`number of char counter.py`}\) module runs the \(\text{`egd for stat proj v1.py`}\) file. This process computes the optimal weights based on the received data.

2. \textbf{Huffman Encoding}:
   - Using the obtained optimal weights, the module `huffman encoder.py` encodes the data and generates a dictionary mapping each character to its corresponding binary string.

3. \textbf{Dictionary Concatenation}:
   - When a user writes another piece of text, the same process is repeated to obtain optimal weights and create a corresponding dictionary.
   - If the ordering of weights remains the same, indicating no significant changes in the character frequencies, the new dictionary is concatenated with the previous one.
   - If the ordering of weights changes, suggesting a shift in character frequencies, the differences in the encoding scheme are noted and incorporated into the dictionary.

4. \textbf{Continuous Operation}:
   - This process continues iteratively as the user inputs more data. At each step, the algorithm adapts to changes in the data and updates the encoding scheme accordingly.

5. \textbf{Decoding}:
   - During decoding:
     - For the first step, the data is decoded directly using the original dictionary.
     - For subsequent steps, changes in the dictionary made during encoding are noted, and decoding is performed accordingly to account for these changes.

This algorithm allows for adaptive encoding and decoding, where the encoding scheme adjusts dynamically based on the observed data patterns. By continuously updating the encoding dictionary, the algorithm efficiently adapts to changes in the input data distribution while maintaining the ability to decode previous and current data streams accurately.
